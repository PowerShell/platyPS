# PlatyPS 2.0 Update

PlatyPS provides module owners with the ability to write PowerShell External Help in MarkDown.
PlatyPS generates downloadable and updatable help.

## For this update

PlatyPS expects Markdown to be authored in a particular way. We have defined a schema to determine
how parameters are described, where scripts examples are shown, and so on. The schema closely
resembles the existing output format of the `Get-Help` cmdlet in PowerShell. One of the primary
goals of this update is to improve the schema. The goal of 2.0.0 release is to maintain
compatibility while fixing the longstanding issues.

This update includes the following goals:

Priorities

- Fix schema so that it contains all of the Help Data we need while maintaining as much
  compatibility as possible with PS 5.1 and Exchange
- Switch markdown engine to markdig
- Fix OPS rendering problems (this may require specific changes in PlatyPS)
  - Set up meeting with Robert after we have YAML conversion to the new schema so we can discuss
    rendering requirements

After the initial release, we should look at new features and consider whether we fork the tool to a
new no-legacy feature set or try to maintain compatibility going forward (ala PowerShellGet 3.0).

## Motivation

PowerShell external help files have been authored by hand or using complex tool chains and rendered
as MAML XML for use as console help. MAML is cumbersome to edit by hand, and common tools and
editors don't support it for complex scenarios like they do with Markdown. PlatyPS is provided as a
solution for allow documenting PowerShell help in any editor or tool that supports Markdown.

An additional challenge PlatyPS tackles, is to handle PowerShell documentation for complex scenarios
(e.g. very large, closed source, and/or C#/binary modules) where it may be desirable to have
documentation abstracted away from the codebase. PlatyPS does not need source access to generate
documentation.

Markdown is designed to be human-readable, without rendering. This makes writing and editing easy
and efficient. Many editors support it (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc), and many tools and
collaboration platforms (GitHub, Visual Studio Online) render the Markdown nicely.

### Help file schema

The following sections outline schema changes for the Help file.

Structure of YAML for parameters

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: PSetName1, PSetName2, PSetName3
Aliases:

Required: True (PSetName1, PSetName2) False (PSetName3)
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: True
DontShow: True
```

#### Schema feature requests

1. Have a way to document aliases for the cmdlet. Today we only document aliases for parameters.
   This is difficult to discover, so don't need `*-MarkdownHelp` cmdlets to create it but the schema
   needs to support it. The author can add the information to the YAML frontmatter. For example:

   ```yaml
   aliases:
     all: [dir, gci]
     windows: [ls]
     macOS:
     linux:
   ```

   Add new H2 for documenting aliases.

   ```markdown
   ## ALIASES

   PowerShell includes the following aliases for `Get-ChildItem`:

   - All platforms: `dir`, `gci`
   - Windows: `ls`
   ```

   See [alias-prototype](alias-prototype.md) for an example.

   See [Issue #585](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/issues/585).

1. Have a some schema format for representing the availability of the cmdlet for a platform
   (win/mac/linux). Could be one or more. Default to Windows but editable by the author.

   ```yaml
   - platforms: win, macOS, linux
   ```

### Formatting note

- General
  - Would like PlatyPS to add a line break after each Markdown block
  - Example - Headers, Code blocks, Lists
  - Bug: `Get-Help`: Requires that the first line of text be immediately following Synopsis header

### About_ file schema

The following sections outline schema changes for the About_ file.

|      Heading      | Level | Required? | Count |                                                        Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title             | H1    | Y         | 1     | - Title should be Sentence Case - About Topic<br>- Title meta data 'about_<Topic>' should match the file basename         |
| Short Description | H2    | Y         | 1     | - Should be Sentence Case                                                                                                 |
| Long Description  | H2    | Y         | 1     | - Should be Sentence case<br>- Should allow multiple Long description subtopics<br>- Should support subtopics at H3 or H2 |
| See Also          | H2    | Y         | 1     | - This is required but may be empty                                                                                       |

General notes

- Should be rendered as plain text compatible with `Get-Help`
- `Get-Help` bug:Synopsis
- [Get-Help bug](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9208)
- Add switch to provide Cabs or Zips. Default: cabs
- Add switch to include markdown Default: off
- About_ schema does not say anything about line wrapping etc.
  - If left as text files, then wrap at 80 columns.
  - But if converted to schema-based line limit is not a problem (for the future). Still a problem
    for previous versions.

## PlatyPS Cmdlets and Parameters

PlatyPS includes a set of cmdlets with parameters.

The following section is a review of the cmdlets for changes to the parameters and their defaults.
We need to decide to what cmdlets and features to keep. We should make a list breaking changes for
documentation.

In case of breaking changes, do we need a legacy mode?

- We don't know until we see what all the breaking changes are
- If we make changes that require changes to Get-Help we will need something that targets a older
  versions PowerShell.

## Cmdlet Feature requests

1. I was wondering if we should default to zips instead, one package for both platforms. Cabs as
   legacy for < 5.1 content. We can fix PS 7.2 to look for zip first and fallback to cab. Add as
   question in spec — This should be a switch - cab, zip or both.

1. Need to know about Merge-MarkdownHelp which uses `applicable:` yaml syntax for version.
   `applicable:` should be mentioned in the schema. — this creates tags…for linux/windows
   parameters. Exchange uses the `applicable:` feature heavily. Need to maintain support for them.

1. Need way to increment the help version number of the CAB files

   - Could be automatic in every build?
   - Could be scheduled?
   - Could be a workflow step (scripted) done by the author
   - Need to figure out limits of version number fields
   - Need rules for when to increment major, minor, subminor, etc. (Semvar?)

### List of things that break with PS5.1 or Exchange
